# code-editor-flask
Code editor written in HTML and CSS using FLask

## Overview
Here's an overview of the components we'll need:

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with Ace editor

- Backend: Flask to handle code execution

  

## Setup
You must have python3 and git.

| OS | git | python3 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| kubuntu 24.04.1 LTS   | 2.43.0, 2.45.2   | Python 3.12.3   |

Change your working directory to code-editor-flask repository

​	`cd path/to/code-editor-flask`

Type
